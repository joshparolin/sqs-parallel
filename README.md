# sqs-parallel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sallar/sqs-parallel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sallar/sqs-parallel)

ðŸ”¥ Since [bigluck/sqs-queue-parallel](bigluck/sqs-queue-parallel) is dead and no
one is checking the issues and PRs, I decided to:

* Rewrite the library in plain JS (look ma! no coffeescript!)
* Fix bugs and issues reported by users of that repo
* Consider including the proposed PRs
* Change callback style methods to return `Promise`s.

sqs-parallel is a **node.js** library build on top of **Amazon AWS SQS** with
**concurrency** and **parallel** message poll support.

You can create a poll of SQS queue watchers, each one can receive 1 or more
messages from Amazon SQS.

With sqs-parallel you need just to configure your AWS private keys, setup one or
more `message` event listeners and wait for new messages to arrive.
